### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

        1. Upon entering the site, the users are greeted to a welcome page which has a carousel showing three images of what the organisation is about and then a little scroll down is an explanation.
        2. The main points are made immediately with the carousel
        3. The user can scroll down to find out what the organisation is and then they can easily navigate to the contact page for any enquiries.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. On the Contact Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily contact the organisation to ask more questions.
        1. Once the new visitor has read the welcome page explaining who the organisation is, they will notice the contact page.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about new books that are being read.

        1. The user can find out more information easily by contacting the organisation.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
        2. Here they can fill out the form on the page.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1.  As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if the locations for meetings have changed.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can find the locations page easily to see if the locations have changed on the map or on the table next to the map, including dates and times.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop and many mobile devices.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   There is a small bug on the right hand side of the page where you can see a little gap on location.html and home.html.
